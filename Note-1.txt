DP is entirely based on recursion.
When we have overlapping subproblem in recursion tree, we need DP to solve it.
example: Fibonacci Series

1. Substructure Property
fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
2. Overlapping Sub Problem

1950 Bellman (Mathematician) invented DP.

DP:
1. Top - Down (Memoization)
2. Bottom - Up (Tabulation)

Bit Manipulation:

1. X-OR

a = 4 
b = 5

4: 0100
5: 0101
   0001 = 1 = a ^ b
   0100 = 4 = a ^ b = 1 ^ 5
   0101 = 5 = a ^ b = 1 ^ 4
