Data Structure:

- It is a data organization
- management
- Storage
- Format
That enables efficient access and modification.

1. Data - Array is a collection of similar types of values/data/elements.
2. Relationships - Concept of ordering element in array e.g: Element Arrange in insertion order
3. Operations - Traverse, Search , Sort etc.

It is a way to organize information in such a way that ww can do useful things with it.
-Storing and accessing a data in such a way, so it will ease of access (CRUD(Create Read Update Delete), Search, Sort).

Algorithm:

- Sequencial Steps to solving a Problem. 
e.g: How to make a tea
There would some steps involves.

Measures of Performance:

1. Time: How do you measure Algo time. Let's take an example:
- If you want to compute the 
  Amount of processing or number of operations code has to perform to Accomplish it's objective.

2. Space or Extra Space:
- This is both Memory needed by code to store information at runtimee, as well as disk space needed by code 
for persistence/permanent storage.
